# Heart Disease Classification Project

## Project Overview

The **Heart Disease Classification Project** is a comprehensive data science and machine learning initiative aimed at developing and implementing effective models to classify heart disease in patients. Leveraging Python, the NumPy library, and cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this project demonstrates the power of data preprocessing and model evaluation. With a focus on predictive accuracy and health outcomes, this project represents a vital contribution to the field of medical diagnostics.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Preparation:** The project starts by meticulously handling the heart disease dataset, a crucial task in medical research. The provided dataset is thoroughly examined, and non-numeric values are converted into numerical formats. To ensure efficiency and accuracy, NumPy is employed to manage and process the data.

- **Perceptron Model (PCN):** A fundamental yet powerful binary classification model, the Perceptron, is implemented. This model is essential for initial insights into heart disease classification. Data is randomly shuffled, and distinct training and testing sets are created. To enhance the Perceptron's performance, data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling, are employed. The project evaluates the accuracy of the PCN model on both raw and preprocessed data, providing valuable insights into its capabilities.

- **Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP):** To tackle more complex classification tasks and account for intricate relationships within the data, an advanced Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP) model is developed. Building upon the foundations laid by the Perceptron, the MLP model is equipped to handle intricate classification tasks. The project goes the extra mile by incorporating feature normalization, optimizing the model's effectiveness. Furthermore, early stopping mechanisms are put in place to mitigate overfitting and enhance training efficiency. As with the PCN model, the MLP model's performance is rigorously evaluated on both raw and preprocessed data.

## Impacts and Significance

- **Improved Patient Diagnostics:** The project directly contributes to enhancing patient diagnostics by providing accurate classification of heart disease. This accuracy can be life-saving, as early detection and appropriate medical intervention are critical in addressing heart-related conditions.

- **Data Preprocessing as a Game-Changer:** Through the evaluation of both raw and preprocessed data, the project showcases the transformative power of data preprocessing. It underscores that data quality and preparation are essential in developing effective machine learning models.

- **Scientific Advancement:** The findings and methods employed in this project contribute to the advancement of medical research and diagnostic techniques. It exemplifies how modern data science techniques can be applied to real-world healthcare challenges.
