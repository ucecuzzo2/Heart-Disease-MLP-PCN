**Heart Disease Classification Project**

*Overview:*
Developed a heart disease classification project using Python and the NumPy library, implementing Perceptron and Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP) models. The project includes data preprocessing to enhance model performance.

*Project Details:*
1. **Data Preparation**
   - The program begins by reading the heart disease dataset from a CSV file.
   - Utilized the NumPy library to efficiently handle and process data, including converting non-numeric values to numerical formats.

2. **Perceptron Model (PCN)**
   - Implemented a Perceptron model for binary classification.
   - Conducted random shuffling of the dataset and separated it into training and testing sets.
   - Performed data preprocessing by scaling features to optimize model performance.
   - Evaluated the accuracy of the PCN model on both raw and preprocessed data.

3. **Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP) Model**
   - Developed an MLP model for more complex classification tasks.
   - Applied feature normalization to enhance the effectiveness of the MLP model.
   - Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve training efficiency.
   - Evaluated the MLP model's performance on both raw and preprocessed data.

4. **Results**
   - Calculated and compared the average accuracy of the Perceptron and MLP models for multiple iterations.
   - Demonstrated how data preprocessing techniques significantly improve model performance in classifying heart disease patients.

*Instructions:*
- The number of iterations for the Perceptron and MLP models can be specified by the user.
- View the average accuracy results for raw and preprocessed data to assess the impact of data preprocessing.

*Usage:*
1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Run the provided code, specifying the desired number of iterations.
3. Observe and analyze the average accuracy results for the implemented models.
